## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer currently completing my Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), graduating in 2026. I specialize in building intelligent applications that combine machine learning with practical, user-friendly interfaces — especially in **Django**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of exciting projects from [EEG-based driving systems](https://github.com/M00d3h/Capstone-LLaVA-Task2) to AI-powered web apps like [LifeXP](https://github.com/LifeXP-App/lifexp-web), where I combine backend logic, AI models, and beautiful frontend designs to bring ideas to life.

- 🧩 **AI + Full Stack Development** (Django, OpenAI API, Tailwind CSS)
- 🧪 **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Transformers)
- 📡 **EEG Signal Processing** (BCI, multimodal fusion)
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** (Render, Vercel, AWS, Wasabi)
