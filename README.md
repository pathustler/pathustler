## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate developer currently completing my Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), graduating in 2026. I specialise in building intelligent applications that combine machine learning with practical, user-friendly interfaces — especially in **Django**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of exciting projects from [EEG-based driving systems](https://github.com/M00d3h/Capstone-LLaVA-Task2) to AI-powered web apps like [LifeXP](https://github.com/LifeXP-App/lifexp-web), where I combine backend logic, AI models, and beautiful frontend designs to bring ideas to life.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- 🧩 **AI + Full Stack Development** (Django, OpenAI API, Tailwind CSS)
- 🧪 **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Transformers)
- 📡 **EEG Signal Processing** (BCI, multimodal fusion)
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** (Render, Vercel, AWS, Wasabi)

### 🧠 [EEG-AI Driving System](https://github.com/M00d3h/Capstone-LLaVA-Task2)

![](https://github.com/pathustler/pathustler/blob/main/f22a.png?raw=true)

An AI-assisted EEG-conditioned autonomous driving system that can analyse the driver’s brainwaves in real-time, predicting their cognitive state, and then making an informed driving decision which considers both the surroundings and internal data.


### 🔮 [LifeXP](https://github.com/LifeXP-App/lifexp-web)

![](https://github.com/pathustler/pathustler/blob/main/Screenshot_2025-05-23_at_2.41.33_PM.png?raw=true)

An AI-powered productivity and self-growth social media platform designed to help users track their daily activities, habits, and personal development through an engaging experience point (XP) system.

### 💼 [OSAAT](https://github.com/SWSC-GIT/osaat)

“One Shade At A Time” (OSAAT) is a management system website I built for SWSunControl, a company based in Arizona that builds sunshades. This system is designed to make things easier for the team by keeping everything in one place—customers, calendar events, orders, workstation processes, etc. [Link to the site](https://ossat.azurewebsites.net)
